# # Open Source WAF 🔐
# A next-generation, machine-learning-powered Web Application Firewall (WAF) for modern cloud-native infrastructures.
#
# ## 🌟 Features
# - ✅ Reverse proxy with ModSecurity + OWASP CRS
# - 🤖 Bot detection middleware (User-Agent filtering, CAPTCHA-ready)
# - 📊 Anomaly detection using Isolation Forest
# - 📈 Real-time dashboards (Grafana + Prometheus)
# - 🔔 Alerting and incident response (Slack, Opsgenie, Email)
# - 🚀 CI/CD deployment pipeline (GitHub Actions)
# - 🌐 Synthetic uptime monitoring (Blackbox Exporter)
#
# ## 📦 Quick Start
# ```bash
# git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/open-source-waf.git
# cd open-source-waf
# docker-compose up -d
# ```
# Visit `http://localhost:3000` for Grafana, `http://localhost:5000` for the ML API.
#
# ## 📂 Project Structure
# - `ml_engine.py`: ML anomaly detection service
# - `bot_protection.py`: Basic bot filter middleware
# - `train_model.py`: Train Isolation Forest
# - `dashboard/`: React-based log viewer
# - `monitoring/`: Prometheus, Grafana, Blackbox config
# - `scripts/`: Test and alert simulation tools
#
# ## 🧠 How It Works
# This WAF inspects HTTP(S) traffic using ModSecurity and enriches decisions using ML-based anomaly detection. Bots are filtered early. Logs and metrics are continuously fed into a real-time dashboard with alerts.
